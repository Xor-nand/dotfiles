# Dotfilez
This is a collection of all my dotfiles. they still are messy enough that i wouldn't reccomend downloading nor using them. I'll keep this repo as active and updated as i can.

## Dumbass features
Some of the most retarded features for these dotfiles.

### Arrow Keys
These are my dotfiles for a couple of keyboard based programs that usually work with Vim keyboard control, being completely autistic, i don't like the vim arrow keys layout, and i decided to move most byndings related to Vim and general movement of things to I, J, K, L... DonÂ´t judge.

### Scripts
In this folder you can find a small collection of more or less useful scripts related mostly to automatization and i3 features like having standardized notifications for my i3 commands and byndings. This is mostly useful TO ME, because of my weird layout needs (IT) and very bad memory...
